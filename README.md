Analysis for marketplace funnel assessment
Thanks for viewing my assessement! After exploring the data, I mainly wanted to focus on what stage of the conversion funnel had the most drop-off, and what metrics could be interpreted to understand this more.


#Ask:

Youâ€™ve been provided with four datasets representing activity from our marketplace platform. Your task is to analyze the conversion funnel from search to successful payment and provide data-driven insights about our business.
## Dataset Description
The data consists of four tables:
1. **all_search_events**: Contains records of search events
2. **view_listing_detail_events**: Contains records of when listings are clicked from the search screen
3. **reservations**: Contains records of booking requests and payments
4. **amplitude_user_ids**: A foreign key table for user IDs
## Assignment
1. **Provide business recommendations**
- Based on your findings, what are 2-3 key recommendations to improve conversion?
- What additional data would you want to strengthen your analysis?
## Deliverables
1. **A Python Notebook Published to Github** with:
