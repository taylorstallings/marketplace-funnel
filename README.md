Analysis for marketplace funnel assessment

This project analyzes the marketplace conversion funnel, highlights the biggest drop-offs, and provides a foundation for targeted improvements and A/B testing.


Thanks for viewing my assessement! After exploring the data, I mainly wanted to focus on what stage of the conversion funnel had the most drop-off, and what metrics could be interpreted to understand this more.

The main visualizations used to support this conclusion are here, as well as in the notebook:
